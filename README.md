Navigation system for self-driving vehicles (C++)

Basic components of autonomous driving are perception, planning and motion control.
- Perception includes sensing the environment to help dynamic planning
- planning helps to drive through desired path
- control is the process of maintaing the balance and track of movements

This project provides data structure for the navigation of self driving car whose reference is supplied by a GPS sensor. 
- This project allows to store multiple desired start and end locations in a way-point database in a format acceptable by the path-planning module.
- Multiple Point of interests can be imported from google maps
- Route structure links all the point of interests between any two given waypoints
